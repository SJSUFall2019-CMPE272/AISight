### First Boot - Raspberry Pi
* Plug in your keyboard, mouse, and monitor cables.
* Now plug the USB power cable into your Raspberry Pi.
* Your Raspberry Pi will boot, and a window will appear with a list of different operating systems that you can install. We       recommend that you use Raspbian – tick the box next to Raspbian and click on Install.
* Raspbian will then run through its installation process. Note that this can take a while.
* When the install process has completed, the Raspberry Pi configuration menu (raspi-config) will load. Here you are able to     set the time and date for your region, enable a Raspberry Pi camera board, or even create users. You can exit this menu by     using Tab on your keyboard to move to Finish.
